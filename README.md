# LucaBot
This is my attempt at a functional discord bot with a handful of commands (see README file for in depth).

Once added to your discord server, LucaBot has some interesting commands which include (command prefix is "?"):

"?god - prints a picture that embodies our server",
"?8ball - ask a question and you get an answer",
"?clear # - it clears # newest messages",
"?coinflip - flips a coin",
"?dm - the bot dms you something special",
"?msg [@] [message] - the bot dms the person your message",
"?spam - spams someone,
"?extra - the bot joins and leaves the server to annoy your friends (use with caution, gets annoying fast)"
